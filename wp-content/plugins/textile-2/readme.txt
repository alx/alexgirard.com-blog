This is a wrapper for Jim Riggs' PHP implementation of Brad Choate's Textile 2.  It is feature compatible with the MovableType plugin. This plugin does not play well with the Markdown, Textile, or Textile 2 plugins that ship with WordPress.  Packaged by Adam Gessaman.

== Description ==

This is a wrapper with configuration panel for [Jim Riggs' PHPTextile](http://jimandlissa.com/project/textilephp) implementation.  Due to non-development by Jim, with the 2.1 release the Textile2 plugin will be incorporating bug fixes independently of Jim's release.

Once installed, you can use [Hobix's Textile Reference](http://hobix.com/textile/) to get an idea of what Textile2 can do.  Or view [Brad Choate's examples](http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2004/02/05/textile-tips) of what you can do with a Textile2.pm workalike.

== Installation ==

To install:

1. Upload the directory 'textile-2' to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin under 'Options > Textile2'
1. Enjoy the goodness that is Textile.
